# International Rock Climbing Recommendation System

Diabetes is a disease that is becoming more common. Peopleâ€™s unhealthy habits, like diets full of sugar and unhealthy fats in 
addition to no exercise, is contributing to this increase. The CDC reports that 34.2 million people or 10% of the US population 
have it. There are 26.9 million people diagnosed and 7.3 million people or 21.4% of the 10% are undiagnosed. 
These are alarming numbers. 

## 1. Problem Statement:
Can this disease be detected early?

## 2.Data
> * This dataset has been collected from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Early+stage+diabetes+risk+prediction+dataset.), using direct questionnaires from the patients of 
Sylhet Diabetes Hospital in Sylhet, Bangladesh and approved by a doctor.
* The dataset consisted of 16 variables plus the response variable that indicated if a patient was positive or negative for 
the disease and there are 520 patients. 

## 3.Data Wrangling
All the variables were binary except for Age which was continuous. The data set was mostly clean with no missing values. 

## 4.Exploratory Data Analysis
* This is a classification problem
* The response variable was balanced

* Test if threre is a difference between the fraction of men and women who tested positive

* Test if there is a relationship between age and getting the disease

## 5.Data processing and model selection
* Logistic Regression gave ROC_AUC score of 0.9789 and precision_recall AUC score of 0.9879
* KNeighbors classifier gave ROC_AUC score of 0.9789 and precision_recall AUC score of 0.9888
* Decision Tree classifier gave ROC_AUC score of 0.9262 and precision_recall AUC score of 0.9638
* Random Forest Classifier gave ROC_AUC score of 0.9262 and precision_recall AUC score of 0.9638
